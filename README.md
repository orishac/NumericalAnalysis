# NumericalAnalysis
My Numerical Analysis course final project.

This project got a grade of 98, finished in top 10 of the class.

In this project I was given several task in numrical analysis to complete.
The task are:
1. Interpolate function f in the closed range [a,b] using at most n points
2. Find as many intersection points of two functions f1 and f2 in a given closed range [a,b]
3. a. Integrate function f in the closed range [a,b] using at most n points

   b. finds the area enclosed between two functions
4. Build a function that accurately fits the noisy data points sampled from some noisy function
5. a. Compute the area of a shape with a given contour

   b. Build a function that accurately fits the noisy data points sampled from
        a closed shape
